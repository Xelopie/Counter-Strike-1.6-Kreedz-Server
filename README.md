# Counter-Strike-1.6-Kreedz-Server

## Description
This is a simple ready-to-go kreedz server for Counter-Strike 1.6 on Windows. It includes some necessary plugins for you to have a practice server or host publicly.

## Disclaimer
Everything in this repository comes from online. I do not own them or make them by my own. They are just being put together to make the kreedz server runable. Some settings or plugins have been modified by me in order to make everything run smoothly so they may look different from their public released versions.

## Major plugins/modules being used
* [AMX Mod X](https://github.com/alliedmodders/amxmodx) `1.9.0.5294`

There is no released version yet. I am still trying to make sure everything works fine. You may just clone the repository and test it on your PC.
